<h1>Devotion from a Young Age</h1>
<p>In the early years, when residing in Rajnagar, although he was too young to have his personal puja, his devotion was such that if his mother or father were performing puja, he would sit next to them and look at the pictorial images with great fascination and attention. On the family’s return to their native Chansad, Shantilal was given his personal puja set by Nana Akshar Swami, which he duly performed every day. Shantilal was firm in adhering to the rule of drinking water or consuming food only after completing his daily puja. He also would make it a point of visiting the Swaminarayan Mandir in the village daily for darshan. That mandir was the place where he recalled his first darshan of Shastriji Maharaj! Swamishri would often say that it was Shastriji Maharaj’s darshan that inspired him as a child to please him and act according to his wishes. </p>
